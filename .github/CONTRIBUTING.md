## Git Workflow

It is advisable to use [`git flow`](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#gitflow-workflow) to ensure a consistent git workflow across the team and contributors.
### Branch Naming

The default branches provided by git flow are:
* `master`
* `develop`
* `feature`
* `hotfix`
* `release`

In this case we are not using `develop`. Work off `master`.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface/ process, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
